> ✨ Solving **1 DSA problem every day** in both **C++** and **JavaScript**, focused on helping **frontend developers** strengthen their core programming and problem-solving skills.

---

## 📌 What is DailyDevDSA?

**DailyDevDSA** is a personal + community-driven initiative to solve one **Data Structures & Algorithms** question every day in **two languages**:

- 💻 **C++** (for speed, interviews, and strong foundational concepts)
- 🌐 **JavaScript** (for frontend devs and web-related roles)

Each solution includes:
- ✅ Clean, commented code
- ✅ Problem description & explanation
- ✅ Time and space complexity analysis

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Improve algorithmic thinking 📈  
- Build a consistent daily habit 🧠  
- Support frontend engineers in becoming stronger developers 🔥  
- Create a high-quality reference in both C++ and JS 🚀  

---

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

```
DailyDevDSA/
│
├── Day01/
│ ├── problem.md
│ ├── solution.cpp
│ └── solution.js
│
├── Day02/
│ ├── ...
│
└── README.md
```

Each day has its own folder containing:
- 📄 `problem.md`: Problem statement and approach
- 💻 `solution.cpp`: C++ solution
- 🌐 `solution.js`: JavaScript solution
